# Maze_A_Star
A pygame program that generators random mazes using a backtrack algorithm. It also alows users to solve the maze using the well known A* algorithm

### Why?
I wanted to implement some data structures that I recently learned. In this project, I used Stack in backtrack algorithm and used Queues in A* algorithm

### Run Maze_A_Star
On terminal type "python Maze_A_Star.py" and a maze will be automatically generated:

<img src='preview%20images/image_1.JPG' height="400" width="400"/>

Right-click to draw and left-click to erase:

<img src='preview%20images/image_2.JPG' height="400" width="400"/>

Press space to automatically solve the maze:

<img src='preview%20images/image_3.JPG' height="400" width="400"/>


#### Note: 
- Ligh-blue boxes are visted boxes that have been found to be nonoptimal
- Green boxes are visted boxes that have been found to be optimal
- White boxes are unvisted boxes
